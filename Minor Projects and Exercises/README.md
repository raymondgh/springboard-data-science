### Data Wrangling Exercise

As practice working with JSON data, I practiced importing data, filling missing values intelligently, and calculating simple summary statistics.

### Meetup Notes

To further understand the data science space and the role of data science plays in today's organizations, I attend meetups from time to time. You can find my notes in this folder!
