## Airflow, Streaming and More Meetup
January 17th, 2018 @ Lyft HQ

### Atmosphere
I found the [SF Big Analytics](https://www.meetup.com/SF-Big-Analytics/events/246039241/) meetup group on Meetup.com after searching for data science. It turned out that the event was specialized for Data Engineering, which was very exciting. How can we use programming to abstract away the more tedious aspects of data science?

The event was at Lyft headquarters. The office was hidden in a semi-secret office park in SoMa near AT&T park. I think it would be a nice place to work! When I got there I found the usual fare: pizza and beer. I found it to be much more crowded than expected; there weren't enough seats for everyone (maybe a good thing since it forced people to network?).

Networking at the event was enjoyable enough. I was fortunate to meet a data scientist at Trulia and a data engineer at Lyft who were both excited for me and my efforts with Springboard. I was able the gather that much of a proficient data scientist's work is with improving models and "feature engineering". I've made a note to study more into this!

The event featured two speakers: Maxime Beauchemin, creator of Apache Airflow, and Gwen Shapira, author of Kafka: The Definitive Guide
