# Data Wrangling

### Objective

To answer the study's core questions about the relationship between US migration and business growth, observations of counties and their attributes of business status, immigration, and emigration are needed for each year between 2005 and 2015. 

### Importing Raw Data

[County Business Patterns data](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml) was acquired by downloading 11 CSV files from the census website, selecting all optional columns to be included. Each was read into a dataframe and columns renamed to remove punctuation. 

[U.S. Population Migration Data](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-migration-data) was aquired by downloading 4 CSV files and 7 ZIP files including 102 XLS files each. These files were further segmented into three different data formats for parsing, and four different filename formats for gathering for batch processing. Unlike the County Business Patterns data, the only year-identifying information in the migration data was found in the filenames. To add this information to the dataframes, dictionaries of years and lists of files were created and iterated over as tuples using the .items() method.

### Diagnosing issues

Missing values were initially identified by comparing the resulting dataframe shapes and uniques before concatenating them, typically by year. To determine how to handle changes in county districting from 2005 to 2015, the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/county-changes.html) was consulted. Based on this information, some counties had missing values filled with 0s and some were backfilled. The census bureau also witholds employee count information when values are low enough to reveal personally identifiable information (less than 10); these missing values were converted to 0s.

Some unidentified county GeoIDs were also discovered by visually examining the data. There is no state with a FIPS code of 97 (most are between 1 and 50). Exploration of the data [documentation](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/1415inpublicmigdoc.pdf) indicates that summary data is included inline and formatted with unused GeoIDs. These were filtered out accordingly.

### Tidying data

The unique identifier was determined to be a "Geo ID" which is a combination of a State FIPS code and a County FIPS code. This information is found on a [Census Help Page](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/geoidentifiers.html) and [Glossary](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro/about/glossary.html). While much more information is available including various CBSAs (combined statistical areas) that are grouped by economic exchange, this can ultimately be described as derivative. GeoIDs were also normalized into 5-digit strings (two for state, two for county).

Data was ultimately pivoted into multi-index dataframes, dropping unneeded columns and filling remaining null values with 0. Lastly, data is saved to three CSV files in the "/data/interim/" folder. However, these files are over the GitHub filesize maximum of 100MB and are added to the .gitignore file.

### Reflection

I used different approaches to wrangle the two sources of data. The approach with the migration data is more sophisticated, including bundling callable functionality into defined functions. This was necessitated by the filename convention, but in retrospect I would probably use a similar approach with the County Business Patterns data as well. A major concern for this dataset is the sheer breadth of the tables. If a model is going to consider detailed datapoints rather than aggregate information, the number columns involved expands by a factor equal to the number of counties (over 3,000) and number of NAICS industries (21).
