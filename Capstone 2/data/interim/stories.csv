23,7445761,pg,661,1395445771,2014-03-21 23:49:31+00:00,Coming Soon to Hacker News: Pending Comments,,"A surprisingly long time ago (2013 was a busy year) I
mentioned a new plan to improve the quality of comments on
Hacker News:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6009523<p>Since I&#x27;m going to check out of HN at the end of this
YC cycle, this was my last chance to get this done.
I didn&#x27;t want the people who are going to inherit
HN from me to have to build it as their
first project, because it interacts with so many
different bits of the code in such subtle ways.<p>So I found time to implement pending comments this
past week, and with any luck it will launch tonight.
Since it&#x27;s a big change, I wanted to warn HN users in
advance.<p>Here&#x27;s how it currently works.  From now on, when
you post a comment, it won&#x27;t initially be live.
It will be in a new state called pending.  Comments
get from pending to live by being endorsed by multiple
HN users with over 1000 karma.  Those users will see
pending comments, and will be able to endorse them by
clicking on an &quot;endorse&quot; link next to the &quot;flag&quot; link.<p>Someone who has a pending comment will have to wait till
it goes live to post another.  We&#x27;re hoping that good
comments will get endorsed so quickly that there won&#x27;t
be a noticeable delay.<p>You can currently beat the system by posting an innocuous
comment, waiting for it to be endorsed, and then after
it&#x27;s live, changing it to say something worse. We explicitly
ask people not to do this.  While we have no software
for catching it, humans will notice, and we&#x27;ll ban you.<p>Along with the change in software will come a change in
policy.  We&#x27;re going to ask users with the ability to
endorse comments only to endorse those that:<p>1. Say something substantial.  E.g. not just a throwaway remark,
or the kind of &quot;Yes you did, No I didn&#x27;t&quot; bickering
that races toward the right side of the page and no
one cares about except the participants.<p>2. Say it without gratuitous nastiness.  In particular,
a comment in reply to another comment should be written
in the spirit of colleagues cooperating in good faith
to figure out the truth about something, not
politicians trying to ridicule and misrepresent
the other side.<p>People who regularly endorse comments that fail one
or both of these tests will lose the ability to
endorse comments.  So if you&#x27;re not sure whether you
should endorse a comment, don&#x27;t.  There are a lot of
people on HN.  If a point is important, someone else
will probably come along and make it without gratuitous
nastiness.<p>I hope this will improve the quality of HN comments
significantly, but we&#x27;ll need your help to make it work,
and your forbearance if, as usually happens, some
things go wrong initially.",,,805,pg

Never received Bitcoins",,"This story dates back to December 8th when I initiated an ACH transfer with CoinBase.com for a total sum of $35,104.11. On that very same day, the system informed me that I would be credited with the bitcoins come December 13th.<p>December 13th came by and it was this past Friday. No coins ever came in, the only thing CoinBase did was lock in a price for me @ $868.91. Again, they locked in a price and didn&#x27;t give me coins on the day they told me they would deliver the coins.Ever since the 13th, my transaction page has been showing the following:<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;R2qEn8E.png<p>As you can tell, the funds cleared their end on the 11th. BUT... it still says pending for crediting the coins.&lt;p&gt;This is how the history page looks like:<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;BQ4fUwZ.png<p>Just take a look at that...it actually says that the transaction has been completed here.<p>Let us now look at the email conversation:<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;6SQht98.png<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;eNlIS0V.png<p>I gave their team eight hours to get back to me and settle the issue. They have now missed that deadline so I am taking this matter a bit public. Further avoidance by them will lead me to make a few calls to news stations. I have the right contacts to easily put myself in the media.<p>Now the real dilemma for me here is the fact that while CoinBase.com has locked in a price for me, because they have failed to deliver I cannot sell my coins at any rate. Bitcoins could drop down to $200, and only then might they deliver the coins. The issue at that point is that I would be down a crazy percent already. If they had delivered the coins on the 13th as they had initially promised to, there would not be this issue.&lt;p&gt;Give me a break, the company just secured $25m in VC and this is how they are treating their clientele.&lt;p&gt;",,,475,mgrunin

Didn&#x27;t the VCs have to do the due diligence?<p>I didn&#x27;t have any direct experience with JustFab. The victim was my girlfriend. Back in January 2012, one of her friends emailed her a link to JustFab, then she bought a pair of shoes from www.justfab.com and never visit the website again. Then 8 months later, in September 2013 she finished her Master study in the US and returned to her home country. She was appalled to find out that her credit card has been charged a $39.95 fee for the last eight months. Yes, $39.95 for 8 months, without getting anything from JustFab.<p>I then did a bit research on the internet. It turned out my girlfriend wasn&#x27;t the only victim. Apparently JustFab works like this: once you buy something from their website, you become their &quot;VIP member&quot; without your knowledge. Then you will have to log into their website between the 1st-5th of each month and click “Skip This Month”. If no action is taken (either skip this month, or cancel your account), they just charge you a $39.95 fee every month.<p>According to article published on BusinessInsider, JustFab &quot;generate about $100 million this year&quot; in sales, I wonder how much of this $100 million are from people like my girlfriend who simply didn&#x27;t read their entire 2,500 words Terms of Service and were unaware that they were charged $39.95 a month for nothing.<p>[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;venturebeat.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;26&#x2F;justfab-sews-up-40m-to-become-global-fast-fashion-empire&#x2F;<p>[2] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;26&#x2F;justfab-has-raised-another-40m-led-by-hong-kongs-shining-capital-to-take-its-fashion-subscription-commerce-model-to-asia&#x2F;<p>ps. This is a re-post of my last year&#x27;s post [3], hoping it will get upvoted to the frontpage of HN so that more people get to know the shady business JustFab does. Apparently VCs don&#x27;t do due diligence any more, as long as scam companies like JustFab can bring them money.<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4592778",,,461,wenxun

I used to wake up and do the grim commute each morning to London from my home and the only thing that made it vaguely ok was Hacker News. It was a great place to go and find interesting articles from genuinely passionate people. It also used to be a really safe place to launch a startup that you'd spent days, weeks, years on - your project. It was a place where you could launch your startup and know you'd get great constructive feedback. People may not necessarily like your site but they'd admire you for having the balls to launch it, for spending time developing something that you hoped could benefit people in some way. They'd want you to succeed and they'd try and help you succeed with feedback that would ultimately help you. Unfortunately, today's Hacker News audience is no longer the same.
Today's Hacker News is a place where users want to snipe at other users and find negative aspects to anything thing submitted. No longer does someone say 'This and this I like but this needs work'. Oh no, now the response is 'Hate this, hate that, this is pointless.'. Hacker News now is about correcting grammar and points scoring. It is pointing out anything negative at all that anyone has done, has said. It is no longer a safe place. It has fast become an acidic forum.<p>I've launched 2 projects (11kclub and Favilous) on here over the last year - both got a similar response. There was nothing constructive, it was just sniping - they saw someone had put themselves up there and they just shot them down. It's a real shame. I hope one day the site returns with the kind of audience it once had. Until that happens, I won't be going on my favourite site anymore - the commute just got a whole lot longer.<p>For now I wish you all the best...<p>Thanks<p>Steve",,,431,sw007

If so, my mind is boggled. I was under the impression there is competition for great employees in Silicon Valley.<p>Here in NYC, if I wanted to be very competitive to hire into any vital position with rare skills, I would anticipate a floor on pay of $125k. I don&#x27;t care if that&#x27;s a designer or a developer or a marketer or what ... I just mean anyone working full time who has a good head on their shoulders and some rare skills.<p>And 0.5-1% equity wouldn&#x27;t move the needle much. I mean, if you have a 5 person company and you bring someone in and give them 1% equity, what is their equity relative to the person sitting next to them? IMHO It&#x27;s a joke. Their ownership is purely symbolic, in a relative sense, and it&#x27;s a symbol of how little they own relative to a founder.<p>Am I completely insane?

All my life, I&#x27;ve struggled with procrastination. I find it very hard to sit down and work on a project without an external motivator, and on many nights I end up vegging out in front of the TV or aimlessly clicking around on the internet. As a result, even though I am successful on an absolute scale — CS degree from a top-10, worked at a startup and a large company, enough savings to last a few years of solo development — by my own metric of success, I am crippled by the feeling that it&#x27;s &quot;too late&quot;. Every day, I read an article by some hot-shot young dev who has a handful of fancy projects behind his belt (not to mention a great website and design sensibility) while I have exactly zero — and he&#x27;s half a decade younger than me! How will I ever be able to catch up? Experience-wise, I&#x27;m still a junior dev.<p>It&#x27;s a constant, irrepressible gnawing in my chest. Every morning, I take tally of my age. Whenever I encounter a technical article, I immediately and compulsively investigate the author&#x27;s age. If I&#x27;m behind — which I always am — I will lock myself in my room and force myself to work, even though I still end up on HN half the time. It&#x27;s exhausting and terrifying, but I also don&#x27;t want to loosen up. At my core, I am intensely ambitious. I have so many great ideas, and knowing that the main obstacle between them and me is only myself keeps me in an endless state of panic.<p>It&#x27;s been getting better. For the first time in my life, my procrastination is starting to get tamed. I&#x27;ve been working hard on my first big project, and I expect it&#x27;s going to be a great one. But I can&#x27;t help but feel that if I had started in earnest at 25, at 21, at 19 — then maybe the list of accomplishments at the end of my life will be longer. Mentally, I&#x27;ve resigned to the fact that I&#x27;ve procrastinated away a decade of valuable time, and it just endlessly haunts me.<p>Does anybody else have this problem? How do you deal with it?",,,408,tastyface

Think of this as the inverse of the &quot;Who is hiring?&quot; monthly threads [2] -- except this is not a whoishiring sponsored or monthly thread (yet).<p>There are a couple of reasons why this thread may be valuable on HN. One, it gives those interested in looking to hire HN enthusiasts a quick view of who is looking for a job. Second, it also gives the HN community a way to give back by helping other HN members find a good fit through networking.<p>If you&#x27;re looking to be hired by a company, please use this thread to let other HN members know.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for talent, by all means, check out the candidates below and if you see a good fit, connect! <i>Please</i> no recruiters, unless specifically indicated (opt-in).<p>If you&#x27;re not hiring&#x2F;looking to be hired, take a look over the candidates below and connect with them if you&#x27;re aware of a potential fit for them.<p>Up&#x2F;Down Voting: I would propose that up&#x2F;down voting be reserved to help promote high quality submissions, and push down those clearly not putting in much effort or are off-topic. Use sparingly.<p>I am loosely proposing the following format (obviously you&#x27;re welcome to use any format you&#x27;d like):<p><pre><code>  [Location], [Remote | Relocation], [Full Time | Contract | Part Time]

  Stack: [Comma delimited list of technologies]

  Resume: [Link to resume]

  Contact: [Email address or other means of contact]

  [Brief overview, what you&#x27;re looking for in a company, etc.]

As someone now in their early 30s I&#x27;m starting to wonder what the mid-late career as a software developer looks like.<p>Do you have to go into management to continue progressing upwards in pay and influence? I know this isn&#x27;t the case at some companies (e.g. Google), but is it rare or common to progress as an individual contributor?<p>Is there a plateau in pay? Is there a drop in pay switching jobs after a certain number of years experience because places are looking for 5+ instead of 20+?<p>Are older devs not looking for new jobs because they have families and want more stability&#x2F;are focussed elsewhere?<p>Is becoming a specialist rather than a generalist the answer?<p>And lastly: if you&#x27;re in your late 30s, 40s, 50s, what are you doing at your job?

My parents are NOT technical people. I offered to get him a Windows license for the machine but he said that it&#x27;s working fine for him.<p>People make jokes about the &quot;year of desktop Linux&quot; but if my dad, without calling me ONCE, can use Linux productively to get things done, then, in my opinion, Microsoft is in trouble. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, their claim to usability in the PC OS world is dying.<p>Maybe this doesn&#x27;t mean a whole lot in the big picture, but Linux has cost Microsoft at least one end-user license for an average computer user.

We also redesigned the way we show these tools (screenshot here: http://paulrouget.com/e/toolboxTesting/).<p>We are now working on defining what should be our next moves, and I'm trying to gather as much feedback as possible.<p>The current plan is to build a bunch of performance-related tools (see https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/mozilla.dev.developer-tools/L9vfZ1-smUI), improve the user interface (better theme), make the tools remotable (for mobile development), and drastically improve the WebConsole (see an experiment here: http://paulrouget.com/e/jsterm.v2/).<p>But we really want to get as much feedback as possible to make sure we're going into the right direction.<p>What do you think we should add/remove/fix in our tools? Anything you miss from Chrome or Opera?

I wish I could say it was 'the best single thing I've ever done' or 'why haven't I done it earlier' but I'm not going to say it. Just to offer the other side of the perspective. And because it wouldn't be honest and I don't give nearly enough fuck to be dishonest. Yeah, seriously, what do I have to lose?<p>It was a bad idea. I moved back with my parents, my freelancing thing barely works, I'm constantly broke, on the verge of poverty, I'm deeply depressed and contemplating suicide. I have to constantly hear my father shout what an idiot I am for quitting a high-paying job. My friends make fun of me for making a retarded life decision. I can't really do anything else, since apparently finding a new job, is kind of hard and I have to go through the whole step where I admit my failure and start over and I don't even know what I want anymore.<p>I thought I would become free, but I've actually become less free as a result of it.<p>Essentially, shit is very hard and I barely have any idea on how to get out of this mess. What doesn't make it any easier is that I'm 20, I have no college diploma, no high school diploma, no idea what the fuck is going on.<p>I'm an idiot, essentially. This post serves mainly as a warning for those who could be in the same position, contemplating quitting. It's not as much fun as you think. It's not like Office Space. I'm not saying you shouldn't quit, but you should really put more thought into it.<p>And fuck, I even had enough savings for four months after quitting. I thought a lot of things through, includes finances etc. I even managed to live by myself for the entire four months until I finally gave in and couldn't pay the rent.<p>It just didn't work out and it feels very painful.",,,325,mannicken

However, this week they sent me an email saying:<p>&quot;Stripe provides a service between banks and our users. In order to provide service to our users, we are urged by our banking partners to keep an eye on all accounts that sign up for our services. We&#x27;ve noticed that you have processed charges that seem to be unauthorized--in order to make charges with credit and debit cards, the owner of the card must consent to the charge. Charges on your account do seem to lack this consent, which unfortunately means that we will no longer be able to offer service&quot;<p>This makes no sense as I have had hundreds of payments and not a single payment has been disputed. So how could it be true that the payments are unauthorised? I have sent Stripe emails explaining this and they will not respond.<p>I am very disappointed. As a member of this community I assumed Stripe would treat developers making a living online with a little more respect. I plan to write a lengthy blog post explaining this in more depth.<p><i>Update: I am currently in contact with Stripe CEO over email. He is dealing with the issue. I will keep everyone updated.</i>",,,304,disappointeddev

Bulletproof protocols usually require peer review, yet there have been zero leaks from the reviewers.  Pools of crypto guys who don't leak stuff are usually employed by governments.<p>The part that puzzles me is why a government would do this.  I can imagine several possibilities:<p>1. To finance their own black operations.<p>2. Because they thought digital currencies were inevitable, and they preferred bitcoin to some potentially more malevolent form.  (Could bitcoin have been worse from a government's point of view?)<p>3. A friend suggested this: because they felt their currency would never become the standard reserve currency, and they felt it was better that no one's be if theirs couldn't be.<p>4. A variant of the above: the US did it because it seemed inevitable that the dollar would eventually lose its place as the standard reserve currency, and better to have it replaced by bitcoin that the yuan.<p>I realize some of these explanations are pretty far fetched, but so is an individual cooking up bitcoin as an intellectual exercise.  Whatever the explanation of bitcoin's origin turns out to be, it will probably be pretty weird.<p>Anyone have opinions about these possible explanations, or other ones?",,,294,pg

I make $130k as a 21 year old and I probably put in 3 hours of real work a day. I&#x27;m a good enough programmer that I can bullshit my way through most stuff and at this point I think people are starting to realize that I&#x27;m a bit slower than I could be. I still push out a lot of code, but I secretly spend 7-8 hours a day doing bullshit at work (reading online, games, etc). I know that I&#x27;ve been given a gift and that I&#x27;m a fucking idiot for wasting it, but I&#x27;ve just become a chronic procrastinator and it sucks.<p>I could be changing the world but instead I&#x27;m putting in the bare minimum and no matter what trick or method I try I can&#x27;t seem to beat it. I&#x27;ve never had a strong willpower to begin with and now it seems to be getting worse (looking back I wish I played more sports).<p>Any advice on how you taught yourself to focus on tasks, build willpower, and get shit done would be helpful. Although, I wonder if I really fucked my brain&#x2F;habits up so much that I&#x27;ll never reach my full capacity. I&#x27;ve been like this for the past 6-7 years and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be going away anytime soon. My dad is also very similar in that he&#x27;s smart enough to bullshit through life but he only works at 10-20% of his full capacity and he never completes anything.<p>Help!?",,,292,procastatron
