# Case Study: Investigating a Drop in User Engagement
_Note: this data is fake and was generated for the purpose of this case study. It is similar in structure to Yammerâ€™s actual data, but for privacy and security reasons it is not real._

### The Problem

> You show up to work Tuesday morning, September 2, 2014. The head of the Product team walks over to your desk and asks you what you think about the latest activity on the user engagement dashboards. You fire them up, and something immediately jumps out:

### Hypotheses

 - A client switched to a competitor along with all their users
 - A new feature was pushed that discourages some segment of users
 - The drop is within normal cyclical activity trends
 - A special promotion or incentive recently ended
 - The service launched on another platform that isn't represented here
 - A large source of traffic dropped in popularity
 - Dropoff was normal but new signups lagged
