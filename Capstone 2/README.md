![Wordcloud](images/wordcloud.png)

Who should I follow on Hackernews? Unlike popular social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, Hackernews has no version of a "news feed," or any content customization for that matter. As the hackernews audience continues to grow, front-page content becomes increasingly general and shallow, decreasing the depth of interaction, and ultimately the value created both for users and for the Y Combinator professional network.
