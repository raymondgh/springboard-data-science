# Hello! Welcome to my Data Science Porfolio
Below, find a list of exercises and projects that demonstrate my data science competency. Each of these projects required me to independently seek resources and understand new topics. A short description is available in the readme for each project, and a Jupyter notebook is supplied to show my solutions. Enjoy!
